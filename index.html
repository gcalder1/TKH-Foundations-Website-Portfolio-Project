                        <p>
                            As an Ecuadorian, American with a strong background in music, education, and community
                            service, I have honed my skills in
                            communication, organization, and teamwork. My professional journey includes assisting with
                            lesson planning, leading activities, and managing conflicts in educational settings, as well
                            as
                            volunteering to support low-income residents and diverse populations. My interest in
                            technology
                            grew while learning HTML and CSS at TKH Foundations, and I am passionate about using my
                            creativity and technical skills to design user-focused web experiences. Fluent in Spanish
                            and
                            dedicated to continuous learning, I am excited to bring my unique blend of talents to the
                            field
                            of web development.

                                My background in music and education has been instrumental in shaping my approach to web
                                development. Leading music lessons and working in early childhood education have honed
                                my
                                ability to communicate effectively and create engaging content that resonates with

                                My tech journey oddly started with being part of a team focused on hosting and

                                popular Minecraft server, where I honed skills in user experience and retention. This
                                sparked my passion for web development, blending aesthetics and functionality to create
                                engaging interfaces for gamers to enjoy.
